Text: The people in Utah who are complaining about the vaccine mandate while ignoring the fact that there is an option that does not include vaccination are probably the same people who didn‚Äôt care that the children of LGBTQ Mormons couldn‚Äôt be baptized at age 8.

Text: Canceling our first *real* vacation (to Utah!) since February 2020 because my fully vaccinated partner has COVID, again, after a likely case in March 2020. 2020-2021, the years that keep on giving. Very lucky these haven't been worse cases, but this still sucks. Send cute pets.
