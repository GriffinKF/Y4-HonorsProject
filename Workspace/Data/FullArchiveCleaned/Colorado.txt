Text: The Covid Act Now case map is turning all the wrong bright fall colors. Rising cases in unvaccinated parts of Colorado is an alarming example. Please keep your masks on so you don't spread asymptomatically, and encourage your loved ones to take the vaccine!

Text: Colorado hospitals can turn away patients as state grapples with covid-19 surge Turn away Covid-19 patients who haven't been wearing masks or been vaccinated. They are putting a strain on hospitals. One exemption would be for maskers &amp; people that are vaccinated.

Text: Hospitals in Larimer County #Colorado, where vaccine hesitancy is fueling a surge, are using 110 % of their I.C.U. beds, according to the local health department. That has forced some patients to double up in rooms, and hospitals in the area are close to turning patients away
